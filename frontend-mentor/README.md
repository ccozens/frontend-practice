# Frontend projects

## Why?

I want to improve my frontend design, both to sharpen my React/HTML/CSS skills and to gather ideas for designing my profile site.

## How?

I'm going to find sources of designs I can build and build them. I'm using Vite/React/Typescript in addition to HTML/CSS, again to sharpen skills.

## What?

Intially, I'll build designs from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home). Later I intend to look at [Frontend Practice](https://frontendpractice.com/). I already had an eye on Frontend Mentor and decided to take the plunge after this [recommendation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqDH5sYzDS8).
