# Frontend Mentor - QR code component

![Design preview for the QR code component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
This is my version of Frontend Mentor's [Results summary component challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/results-summary-component-CE_K6s0maV) challenge. The only change from the design is I changed the media breakpoint set to 840px (375px specified in design guide) as that was the point the layout began to deform for me, so this maintains better readbility.

HTML + CSS + JS
